What is Git and Github?

  Git is a version control system for computer terminals. Git tracks a directory called a
  repository and the user can specify what files in that directory can be saved in the cloud.
  When a user "clones" a git repository they can start running commands to make changes to the
  files in the cloud so that other team members can "pull" the changes on their local devices.
  
  Github is simply a website to view and manage your Git profile and repositories.
  

Instructions:

Make an account at https://github.com

Here is a video tutorial to install git, along with cloning repos, and making changes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4

Run the following commands:   (Note: You can choose any directory you want.)
- mkdir ~/UnityProjects
- cd ~/UnityProjects
- git clone https://github.com/JustinMarotta13/SienaARChemistry.git
- cd SienaARChemistry

Close the terminal.

Open Unity Hub.
Click Add in the Projects screen.
